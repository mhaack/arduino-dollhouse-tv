# Arduino Dollhouse Mini TV

The dollhouse Mini TV is a small Arduino project using an cost-efficient ESP8266 chip and a SSD1306 OLED display to built a small working TV for my daugthers birthday. She already had an older plastic TV showing some yellowed picture and the project brings that TV to live.
